	<h3>May 22, 2011</h3>
	<p>The original Brace Place was totally destroyed in the May 22 Joplin tornado.
	Dr. Joseph would have been celebrating 25 YEARS at that location this summer.
	But we were blessed to have no loss of life at the Brace Place or any of our immediate families.<br />
	We are now at 10th & Maiden Lane, located in the same building as Dominoâ€™s Pizza.</p>
