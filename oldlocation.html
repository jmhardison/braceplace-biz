	<p>The original Brace Place was totally destroyed in the May 22 Joplin tornado.
	Dr. Joseph would have been celebrating nearly 30 YEARS at that location this summer.
	But we were blessed to have no loss of life at the Brace Place or any of our immediate families.<br />
	We are now located at 10th & Maiden Lane in the same building as Domino's Pizza.</p>
