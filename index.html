								<h2>Welcome to The Brace Place</h2>
								<p>Our office is not run like a "factory": we accept a limited number of patients. <br />
                                This allows us to give more specialized attention to each patient. <br />
                                We have a small office and a small staff: you will not just be a "number" to us! <br />
                                We feel this is the formula for success in achieving quality results.</p>

								<h2>Goal</h2>
								<p>Our goal is to provide the highest quality orthodontics for a fair price, in a professional yet casual atmosphere.
                                Orthodontic treatment is a gift that will last a lifetime. It's an investment in self-confidence as well as good health
                                and well-being. Having a beautiful smile will be appreciated by every person you encounter for the rest of your life!
                                We normally do not charge for the initial exam. Dr. Joseph will make a quick examination to determine the problem.</p>

								<h2>Q and A with Dr. "J"</h2>
								<p>Here are some answers to common questions we receive.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-question">
									<h3>At what age should a child first see an orthodontist?</h3>
									<p>Normall around age 8. At this age we just need to make sure there are not any major problems.
                                        Only about 5% of patients at this age need treatment. Of course, if you or your dentist feel
                                        something needs specific attention, please let us know.
                                    </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-question">
									<h3>What is the best age for braces?</h3>
									<p>The best time is just after the baby teeth have fallen out, usually around age 11 or 12. 
                                        Prior to this age, if there are no significant problems, we will monitor the development 
                                        with short observation appointments every 6 to 12 months.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-question">
									<h3>Why do I need braces?</h3>
									<p>Dental health is the most important reason. If your teeth and jaws do not line up properly, 
                                        tooth decay and gum disease can develop. Appearance is also an important reason for 
                                        wearing braces. Many people have orthodontic treatment because they simply aren’t happy 
                                        with the way their teeth look.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-question">
									<h3>How long does braces treatment take?</h3>
									<p>Orthodontics generally requires 18-24 months of active treatment (monthly visits) which is 
                                        followed by a few months of “retention” guidance.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-question">
									<h3>What about my regular dentist?</h3>
									<p>You’ll need to continue to make regular visits (every 6 months) to your family dentist throughout 
                                        your treatment. Periodic check-ups are important in order to prevent tooth decay and gum disease.</p>
