	<p>After our old office was destroyed, we took up temporary residence in an existing office building.
	After almost five years, we are close to moving into our new permanent location. <br />
	<br />
	The Brace Place will be relocating to the newly built Neighborhood Center close to our original location, behind the new Wal-mart Neighborhood Market.<br />
	1701 W. 26th Street, Joplin, MO<br />
	<br />
	Current expected relocation date: May 1st, 2016</p>
