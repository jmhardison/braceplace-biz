	<p>After our old office was completely destroyed in the Joplin tornado, we relocated to a temporary office.
	On the 5 year anniversary of the tornado we moved to our new permanent location, across the street from our original office. <br />
	<br />
	We are now located in the newly built Neighborhood Center, just west of the new Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market on 26th & Maiden Lane.<br />
